## [v0.32.0](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/tag/v0.32.0) â€” July 14, 2024

### Changes

* Fix `Survival` objective go to elevator text
* Added Nightmare/Zoomer scouts to E-tier
* Improve zone time factor estimates. For details see `GetClearTimeEstimate` in `Zone`. Time estimates now add time base on the following factors:
  * Zone size, also increased time factor for coverage by 17%
  * Alarm to enter zone: number of scans, sum of duration of each scan, distance between scans
  * Blood doors to enter zone
  * Total enemy points in the zone
  * Fixed times per boss in zone and behind blood doors


## [v0.31.0](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/tag/v0.31.0) â€” July 13, 2024

### New

## [v0.30.0](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/tag/v0.30.0) â€” July 13, 2024

### New

* Added Power Cell Distribution objective to Secondary/Overload objectives.
* Added `FLUSH_VENTS` variant of Special Terminal Command objective (bring your fog repellers!)

### Changes

* Fixed issue with HSU Find Sample and some related zone placement code not returning any valid zones. Should fix several cases of Autogen crashes on startup
* Increased relative chance of Service complex spawning from 50% to 70%. Mining / Tech have 100% relative chance.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0


## [v0.29.0](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/tag/v0.29.0) â€” July 12, 2024

### Changes

* Fix `Complex` not being set in D-tier reactor startup mission. Reactor tile should spawn correctly now.
* Adjust reactor startup code fetch terminal placements from `AtEnd` to `NotAtStart`. Terminals will now spawn in the middle/end of the zone instead of just at the end of the zone.
* Update `GatherSmallItems`, `SpecialTerminalCommand`, and `HSUFindSample` to use layout Planner both for zone placement and objective item placement. This should fix issues with items spawning before the Main bulkhead door.
* Slightly reduce chance of Prisoner Efficiency missions. This is temporary to help reduce chance of level generation lockup.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/compare/v0.28.0...v0.29.0

### New

* Added Reactor Geomorph for Service Complex. Reactor startup/shutdown missions previously could not be used in the Service complex (Floodways, Gardens) as there was no geomorph in those complex tilesets. This release adds a dependency on FlowGeos which provides a reactor geo for floodways.
