### Changed

* Reduced number of zones before reaching reactors in Startup/Shutdown missions. Reactor I-tile/corridor now spawns immediately after the bulkhead door instead of several preamble zones.

## [v0.24.0](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/tag/v0.24.0) â€” June 25, 2024

## New

* Added Reactor Geomorph for Service Complex. Reactor startup/shutdown missions previously could not be used in the Service complex (Floodways, Gardens) as there was no geomorph in those complex tilesets. This release adds a dependency on FlowGeos which provides a reactor geo for floodways.

## Changes

* Reactor Startup D-tier mission is now a fixed regular level, not just a test level
* Fixed Service complex to use both Floodways and Gardens
* Fixed several warnings being thrown by duplicate alarm names
* Fixed `Baseline_Hard` wave settings including `Weakling` enemy types. This fixes many waves spawning shadows which should not have.
