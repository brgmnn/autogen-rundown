<!--
* Can we have boosters generate progression for us

JQ Commands for checking blocks:

Check Alarm Persistent IDs for levellayout

  jq -r '.Blocks | map(select(.name | test("^[0-9]+_B1")) | {name, zones: .Zones | map({ChainedPuzzleToEnter})})' build/34855/GameData_LevelLayoutDataBlock_bin.json


TODO:
  * Use Zone Prefix Override to alert to specific tiles.
  * Enable unit tests again after fixing chained puzzles.
  * Don't allow small item pickup to have so many extras that we don't need to do all the zones
  * Make giants blood door a bit harder? B-tier was easy
  * Rework lights on zone to load into lightsettings and let us set our own light settings
  * Make extract scan short if there's no extract alarm (Don't do it just based on level tier)
  * Add a way to automatically install deps?
  * Rising fog?
  * Objective: Distribute Power Cells
    * Needs something to happen when completing all the cells ideally
    * Would be good if the fog could rise or lower when inserting the cells

2025_05_14
  * E3
    [ ] Scout Waves not spawning
      * Couldn't reproduce though? :eyes:
    [x] Main / mega mom should be set back to default spawns. Double all spawns and maybe increase spawn rate
    [x] Extract not checking for the item
    [x] No extract alarm

2025_05_09
  [x] Don't give error alarm doors for free all the time
  [x] Fix item zone for cargo pickup
  [x] Increase distance between scans on harder levels
  [ ] Null error thrown at end of D2

2025_05_06
  [ ] Consider reducing the occurence of nightmare enemies
  [ ] Giant Onion error alarm? Probably close to boss tier
  [ ] Giant Onions feel a little squishy? May be due to high overbalance of Arsenality
    [ ] Maybe we up them to 200 health?

2025_04_29
  * D1: Error alarm with no turn off is quite a bit harder
    * Probably we need a few less alarms
    * Might want to have fewer enemies on reactor fetch code tiles
    * D1 had A LOT of zones to run through, may want to not have multiple zones of fetch codes and do single zone fetch codes
    * For fetch codes that have zones not starting at reactor, need to factor traverse time to get there and back
  * D1 (or D2?)
    * Need to fix the zone count for layout for reactors
      * Maybe consider using a different layout for it?
    * Consider if we reduce number of fetch codes from 6 to 5
    * May need to BUFF the reactor waves a little


2025_04_25
  * E1: ~Error alarm turn off zone also disables the survival alarm?!~
    * Edit: Actually it just hides the countdown

Weekly 9-A1 bug:
  * Doesn't seem to be the chained puzzles.. Unclear for now
  * Disappears if I disable EITHER overload or secondary
  * It appears to be the map layout. I suspect it's the door not having a place to place though

Exit Geo failures to spawn:
  * Assets/Bundles/RLC_Mining/geo_64x64_mining_storage_exit_hub_RLC_01.prefab
  * Assets/geo_64x64_dig_site_exit_dak_01.prefab
Working exit geos
  * Assets/Prefabs/Geomorph/Mining/geo_storage_FA_dead_end_01.prefab

  Note: It may well be a space issue. The two failed tiles are quite large, so when they don't spawn it might just be that there isn't space for them.

Monthly April
  * Find HSU seems like it needs re-rolling occasionally. May be some of the levels can't place well
  * Need to take another look at balance for reactor shutdown. D/E looks to either be way too hard or way too easy.
  [ ] Check if we can use a mod like https://thunderstore.io/c/gtfo/p/W33B/Arsenality/
    * Seems like it adds datablock files directly
  * Try using fixed bioscan points for room wide scans?
  [ ] B1 Secondary (Cryo) - No exit alarm
  [ ] C4 - Security sensors spawn LOADS of snatchers
  [ ] E1 - Maybe a bit too easy?
  [ ] D1 - Activate small HSU doesn't require the objective to exit
      - Can we exclude double mother / double tank from first zone

Monthly March
  * March 27th
    * E2
      * Time maybe too generous, finished with 2:30 left
  * Yoshi Feedback
    [ ] May want to look in to making it so error alarm terminals don't cancel others. Many instances of trivialized scans because of error turnoff.

Monthly Feb
  * Double cargo B1 -- Not sure why?
  * Reactor D2
    [ ] Mother wave had good amount of time. DONT CHANGE

Missing tiles to add
  * Add R8A1 garden hub tile to hubs

Automatic Rundown generation, using procedural seed based generation. Three active rundowns to choose from: the daily, weekly, and monthly. Play with friends with zero configuration of seeds.

![Rundown Selection](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/blob/03583187a757755e486623da73d4712e00187be7/docs/rundown_selection.jpg?raw=true "Rundown Selection")

Track your progression in each rundown separately from the base game and other modded rundowns, see if you can clear them "Unaugmented"! (Without boosters)

![Monthly Rundown Preview](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/blob/03583187a757755e486623da73d4712e00187be7/docs/monthly_rundown.jpg?raw=true "Monthly Rundown Preview")

Levels and rundowns are designed to be similar and in the spirit of vanilla GTFO. The largest difference is in the addition of new tilesets (geomorphs) to add more variety to the existing games set of tiles.

## Installation

### With Mod Manager

Go to the Autogen Rundown Thunderstore mod page (https://gtfo.thunderstore.io/package/the_tavern/AutogenRundown/) and install via your mod manager.

### Manual Installation ðŸ“¦
Download the latest version of the mods manual install zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/latest).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Backup your GTFO game folder before copying any mod files in so you can easily restore it

1. Back up your GTFO game folder (`<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO`)
  * Right click on GTFO in steam, select "properties", select "Installed Files"
  * Click "Browse..." at the top
  * Windows File Explorer will open inside the GTFO game folder. Navigate up one level and copy/paste the folder. Name it appropriately for your backup (eg. `GTFO_backup`).
1. Extract the `Autogen_manual_install_<Version>.zip` archive into a folder. *Do not extract into the game folder*.
2. Move the contents of `AutogenRundown_GTFO` into the GTFO game folder: `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO`.
3. Run the game.

If done correctly, after the game launches you should see a watermark in the bottom right corner of the game identifying the mod version and current seed.

#### Uninstalling the mod

To uninstall the mod, open `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common` and delete the GTFO game folder `GTFO`. Then rename your backup GTFO game folder (eg. `GTFO_backup`) to `GTFO`.

If you did not make a backup of the game: delete the GTFO game folder and run "Verify integrity of game files" from the Steam "Installed Files" properties menu. This will redownload the GTFO game folder.

#### Updating to the latest mod version

Follow the installation instructions again, check yes to overwrite all files.
