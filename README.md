Automatic Rundown generation, using procedural seed based generation.

## Installation

### With Mod Manager

Go to the Autogen Rundown Thunderstore mod page (https://gtfo.thunderstore.io/package/the_tavern/AutogenRundown/) and install via your mod manager.

### Manual Installation ðŸ“¦
Download the latest version of the mods manual install zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/brgmnn/autogen-rundown/releases/latest).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Backup your GTFO game folder before copying any mod files in so you can easily restore it

1. Back up your GTFO game folder (`<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO`)
  * Right click on GTFO in steam, select "properties", select "Installed Files"
  * Click "Browse..." at the top
  * Windows File Explorer will open inside the GTFO game folder. Navigate up one level and copy/paste the folder. Name it appropriately for your backup (eg. `GTFO_backup`).
1. Extract the `Autogen_manual_install_<Version>.zip` archive into a folder. *Do not extract into the game folder*.
2. Move the contents of `AutogenRundown_GTFO` into the GTFO game folder: `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO`.
3. Run the game.

If done correctly, after the game launches you should see a watermark in the bottom right corner of the game identifying the mod version and current seed.

#### Uninstalling the mod

To uninstall the mod, open `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common` and delete the GTFO game folder `GTFO`. Then rename your backup GTFO game folder (eg. `GTFO_backup`) to `GTFO`.

If you did not make a backup of the game: delete the GTFO game folder and run "Verify integrity of game files" from the Steam "Installed Files" properties menu. This will redownload the GTFO game folder.

#### Updating to the latest mod version

Follow the installation instructions again, check yes to overwrite all files.
