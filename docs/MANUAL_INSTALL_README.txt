# Installation

To install the mod, follow these steps:

1. Back up your GTFO game folder (`<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO`)
    * Right click on GTFO in steam, select "properties", select "Installed Files"
    * Click "Browse..." at the top
    * Windows File Explorer will open inside the GTFO game folder. Navigate up
      one level and copy/paste the folder. Name it appropriately for your
      backup (eg. `GTFO_backup`).
2. Move the contents of `AutogenRundown_GTFO` next to this file into the GTFO
   game folder: `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO`.
3. Run the game.

If done correctly, you should see a console appearing when the game launches.


# Uninstalling

To uninstall the mod, open `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common` and delete the
GTFO game folder `GTFO`. Then rename your backup GTFO game folder
(eg. `GTFO_backup`) to `GTFO`.

If you did not make a backup of the game: delete the GTFO game folder and run
"Verify integrity of game files" from the Steam "Installed Files" properties
menu. This will redownload the GTFO game folder.
