# Installation

To install the mod, follow these steps:

2. Move the contents of "AutogenRundown_GTFO" next to this file into "<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\GTFO".
3. Run the game.

If done correctly, you should see a console appearing when the game launches.



# Uninstalling

To uninstall the mod, run "Verify integrity of game files" from the steam installed files menu for GTFO.

Alternatively if you backed up your GTFO folder before making any changes, you can restore the original GTFO folder.
