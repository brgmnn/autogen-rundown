# Travel Scan System - Developer Guide

Travel scans replace the base game's stationary moving-scan behavior with walking circuits that force players to move through entire zones. Instead of shuffling between positions in a tight radius, the scan traces a NavMesh loop through the zone.

## The Problem

Base game moving scans use `LG_NodeTools.TryGetPositionsOnRadiusDistancedFromEachother` to scatter waypoints in a radius around the spawn point. Players stand in roughly the same spot. Travel scans create a looping circuit through the zone using NavMesh pathfinding, turning a stationary encounter into a walking one.

## Puzzle Type Taxonomy

### Naturally Movable (prefab includes CP_BasicMovable)

| ID | Name | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| 22 | `SecurityScan_Big_RequireAll_Movable` | Big scan, require all, moving |
| 31 | `SecurityScan_Big_Movable_FadeIn` | Big movable, fade-in visual |
| 38 | `SecurityScan_Big_Movable_FadeIn_RequireAll` | Fade-in, require all |
| 42 | `SecurityScan_Big_Movable` | Big movable scan |
| 43 | `SecurityScan_Movable_Small` | Small movable scan |
| 52 | `SecurityScan_Big_Movable_Slow` | Big movable, slow speed |
| 60 | `SecurityScan_Big_Movable_FadeIn_Slow` | Fade-in, slow speed |

These types already have `CP_BasicMovable` on their prefab with `IsMoveConfigured = true`. Patch_SetupMovement intercepts all of them to replace radial position generation with NavMesh circuits.

### Runtime-Injected (type 100)

| ID | Name | Duration | Speed |
|----|------|----------|-------|
| 100 | `SustainedTravel` | 120s | 2.0 m/s |

Type 100 is special: the base game sustained scan prefab has no `CP_BasicMovable` component. The system injects one at runtime via `AddComponent<CP_BasicMovable>()` and writes its serialized fields through IL2CPP pointer arithmetic. This is the only type that also gets the reverse mechanic.

## Lifecycle

```
Init        Plugin.cs → GameDataAPI.OnGameDataInitialized += TravelScanRegistry.Setup
            TravelScanRegistry.Setup registers LevelAPI.OnLevelCleanup += Clear

Setup       ChainedPuzzleInstance.Setup fires during level build
            → Patch detects type 100, sets PendingSustainedTravel flag
            → CP_Bioscan_Core.Setup fires, patch injects CP_BasicMovable
            → Pointer stored in SustainedTravelInstances

Movement    ChainedPuzzleInstance.SetupMovement fires for all movable types
            → Patch_SetupMovement generates NavMesh loop, sets positions
            → Returns false to skip base game radial generation

Gameplay    Scan activates, CP_BasicMovable drives forward movement
            → Reverse patch monitors state changes and Update() calls
            → If paused (players left scan), drives scan backward

Cleanup     LevelAPI.OnLevelCleanup → TravelScanRegistry.Clear()
            → Clears SustainedTravelInstances and _reversing dictionary
            → Critical: prevents stale IntPtr dereference on next level
```

## Networking Model

Path generation is **deterministic across clients**. All clients call `SetupMovement` during level build with the same AI graph, NavMesh, and spawn positions, producing identical waypoint lists. No path data is sent over the network.

Forward movement is driven by `CP_BasicMovable`'s built-in `pMovableStateSync` replicator, which syncs `lerp` (position along path) and `paused` (whether requirements are met).

Reverse movement runs **master-only** (`SNet.IsMaster`). The master writes `m_lerpAmount` and `m_currentState.lerp` directly, and the existing `pMovableStateSync` replication propagates the reversed position to clients. If all clients ran reverse logic, the scan would reverse 4x as fast.

## Key Constants

| Constant | Value | Location |
