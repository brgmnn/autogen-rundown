# Central Generator Cluster Objective

## Overview

The **Activate Generator Cluster** (or **Central Generator Cluster**) is a mission objective in GTFO that requires players to retrieve Power Cells from various zones and deliver them to generators located in a central location. It is essentially the inverse of the [Distribute Power Cells](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Distribute_Powercells) objective.

## Objective Description

In this objective type, Power Cells are scattered throughout different zones of the expedition, and players must locate, retrieve, and transport them to a centralized Generator Cluster. Unlike the Distribute Power Cells objective where cells start in one location and must be delivered to scattered generators, the Central Generator Cluster requires gathering cells from multiple locations to power a central cluster.

## Core Mechanics

### Power Cell Collection

- **Scattered Locations**: Power Cells are found within the expedition across various zones
- **Terminal Usage**: Using terminals to locate Power Cells is highly recommended
- **Transportation**: Players must carry Power Cells (large items) to the Generator Cluster
- **Team Coordination**: Requires teamwork to efficiently locate and transport multiple cells

### Fog Interaction

A key mechanic of this objective is its interaction with the Fog environmental hazard:

- **Fog Increase**: Each Power Cell inserted into the Generator Cluster usually makes the fog worse
- **Progressive Clearing**: As more generators are powered, fog dissipates from the map, making navigation easier
- **Strategic Insertion**: It's recommended to insert Power Cells as you collect them rather than gathering all first

### Final Power Cell Mechanics

Inserting the final Power Cell typically triggers significant gameplay changes:

- **Alarm Activation**: May trigger a CLASS V ALARM or Error Alarm upon final insertion
- **Fog Clear**: In some many expeditions, fog is cleared after the final cell
- **Continuous Spawns**: May initiate continuous enemy spawning (e.g., 3 Strikers every ~10 seconds)
- **Extraction Requirement**: The alarm must often be completed before extraction is available

## Recommended Strategy

1. **Insert Early Cells First**: Insert at least 2-3 Power Cells before collecting the final one
2. **Change the Fog**: Sometimes lowering fog early makes subsequent cell retrieval easier
3. **Prepare for Final Cell**: Ensure team is ready for alarm/enemy waves before inserting the last cell
4. **Use Terminals**: Locate all Power Cells via terminal before starting collection
5. **Coordinate Transport**: Plan efficient routes and coordinate who carries cells

## Notable Expeditions

Several expeditions feature the Central Generator Cluster objective:

- **[ALT://R2D1](https://gtfo.wiki.gg/wiki/ALT://R2D1)**: Requires 5 Power Cells; final cell triggers CLASS V ALARM
- **[ALT://R3A2](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/ALT://R3A2)**: Tutorial-friendly mission; final cell returns fog and starts Error Alarm
- **[ALT://R5C2](https://gtfo.wiki.gg/wiki/ALT://R5C2)**: 5 Power Cells in Zone 212; each lowers Infectious Fog
- **[R7C2](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/R7C2)**: 2 Power Cells; lowers Infectious Fog and deactivates Error Alarm
- **[R8C2](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/R8C2)**: Main objective in Rundown 8.0 C-Tier

## Comparison to Distribute Power Cells

| Aspect | Central Generator Cluster | Distribute Power Cells |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Power Cell Source** | Scattered across zones | Given at mission start in cargo crate |
| **Generator Location** | Centralized cluster | Scattered across multiple zones |
| **Player Movement** | Gather cells from zones → central location | Central location → deliver to zones |
| **Fog Mechanic** | Each cell clears fog progressively | Varies by mission |
| **Complexity** | Higher (exploration + transport) | Moderate (known cells, find generators) |

## Tips

- **Communication is Key**: Call out Power Cell locations when found
- **Don't Rush the Final Cell**: Prepare defenses and resupply before triggering the final alarm
- **Fog Management**: Take advantage of clearer visibility after each insertion
- **Terminal Commands**: Use `LIST` and zone-specific queries to locate cells efficiently
- **Resource Management**: Save consumables for the final cell alarm sequence
