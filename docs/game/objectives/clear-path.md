# Clear Path Objective

## Overview

**Clear Path** (also known as **Clear a Path**) is the simplest and most straightforward objective in GTFO. It requires prisoners to navigate through the Complex to reach a designated extraction point. Despite its apparent simplicity, this objective presents significant challenges through complications such as alarm systems, locked security doors, generator power restoration, key hunting, and intense enemy encounters during the final extraction run.

## What is Clear Path?

Clear Path is a navigation and survival objective where the primary goal is simply reaching the extraction point alive. Unlike objectives that require collecting items, operating reactors, or completing terminal sequences, Clear Path focuses purely on movement through the Complex and surviving the journey. However, the path is never truly "clear" - prisoners must overcome environmental obstacles, security systems, and sleeper encounters to reach their destination.

## Objective Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Navigation

1. **Check Warden Objective**: Confirm that the objective is to reach extraction
2. **Orient to Goal**: Determine general direction toward extraction point
3. **Resource Gathering**: Collect ammunition, health, and tools from starting area
4. **Terminal Reconnaissance**: Use terminals to scout the path ahead
5. **Team Preparation**: Ensure all players are equipped and ready

### Phase 2: Path Navigation

1. **Zone Progression**: Move systematically through zones toward extraction
2. **Overcome Obstacles**:
   - **Locked Doors**: Find keys using terminal commands (`LIST KEYS`, `QUERY KEY_###`)
   - **Security Scans**: Complete bioscan sequences to unlock doors
   - **Alarm Doors**: Navigate chained puzzles and survive alarm sequences
   - **Generator Restoration**: Deliver power cells to restore zone power
3. **Clear Threats**: Eliminate or stealth past sleepers blocking the path
4. **Resource Management**: Conserve ammunition and consumables for extraction
5. **Map Awareness**: Track progress and maintain sense of direction

### Phase 3: Reaching Extraction

1. **Locate Extraction Point**: Navigate to the designated extraction zone
2. **Prepare Defenses**: Before triggering extraction, set up defensive positions
3. **Sentry Placement**: Position automated sentries to cover extraction scan area
4. **Resource Check**: Ensure team has sufficient ammunition and health
5. **Team Coordination**: Assign defensive positions and roles

### Phase 4: Extraction

1. **Initiate Extraction Scan**: Begin the final bioscan at extraction point
2. **Defend Position**: Hold off enemy waves during scan completion
3. **Error Alarms**: If error alarm triggered, fight through continuous spawns
4. **Scan Completion**: At least one player must survive the full scan duration
5. **Mission Complete**: Successfully extract to complete objective

## Core Mechanics

### Navigation Obstacles

**Locked Security Doors:**
- Require keys found elsewhere in the Complex
- Use terminal commands to locate keys
- Keys may be in dangerous zones requiring careful retrieval

**Power Restoration:**
- Some zones lose power and require generator activation
- Power cells must be found and delivered to generators
- Restoring power may trigger enemy spawns

**Alarm Systems:**
- Security doors with chained puzzle alarms
- Error alarms that cannot be deactivated
- Survival required during alarm sequences

**Bioscan Sequences:**
- Security scans requiring team presence
- Vulnerable positions during scan completion
- May trigger additional enemy spawns

### Extraction Mechanics

**Extraction Scan:**
- Final bioscan required at extraction point
- Duration varies by expedition
- At least one player must complete scan for mission success
- Commonly triggers error alarm with continuous enemy spawns

**Error Alarm on Extraction:**
- Many expeditions trigger error alarm when extraction begins
- Continuous enemy spawns until scan completes
- Cannot be deactivated - must survive through combat

### Speed vs Preparation

**Run and Gun Strategy:**
- Move quickly to extraction after completing prerequisite objectives
- Minimize time spent in alarm zones
- Risk: less defensive preparation at extraction

**Methodical Preparation:**
- Clear path thoroughly, set up sentries along route
- Establish fallback positions with C-Foam reinforcement
- Walk the path once to learn layout and ladder positions
- Risk: extended time may deplete resources

## Recommended Strategy

### Before Starting Main Push

1. **Terminal Scouting**: Use terminals to identify obstacles ahead
   - `LIST KEYS` - Locate required keys
   - `LIST CELL` - Find power cells if needed
   - `PING` - Directional guidance to objectives
2. **Resource Mapping**: Identify ammo and health stations along route
3. **Path Reconnaissance**: Scout the path if possible before committing
4. **Team Loadout**: Balance weapons for both stealth and combat

### During Navigation

1. **Stick Together**: Maintain team cohesion throughout navigation
2. **Clear Methodically**: Don't leave sleeping enemies behind your team
3. **Conserve Resources**: Save heavy ammunition and mines for extraction
4. **C-Foam Selectively**: Use on critical doors to slow pursuit during retreat
5. **Bio Tracker Active**: Constantly ping moving enemies for team awareness
6. **Mark Hazards**: Call out scouts, patrols, and alarm doors

### Extraction Preparation

1. **Scout Extraction Zone**: Locate exact extraction scan location
2. **Sentry Setup**: Place 2-4 sentries covering main approach routes
   - Position at chokepoints, not in open areas
   - Face toward expected enemy spawns
3. **C-Foam Doors**: Reinforce doors leading to extraction area
4. **Ammo Check**: Top off ammunition before triggering scan
5. **Escape Route**: Plan fallback route if position gets overrun (rarely needed)

### During Extraction Scan

1. **Don't All Stack**: Spread slightly to avoid group wipes from explosions
2. **Kill While Moving**: Stay mobile within scan area
3. **Priority Targets**: Focus fire on high-threats (Giants, Chargers, Shooters)
4. **Sentry Maintenance**: Protect sentries from being destroyed
5. **Bio Tracker Pings**: Constantly tag moving enemies for sentry targeting
6. **One Must Survive**: If things go badly, prioritize one player finishing scan
7. **Don't Stick Around**: Complete scan and GTFO immediately

### After Objective Completion

If you've completed secondary objectives before extraction:

1. **Don't Linger**: Move to extraction immediately
2. **Book It**: Error alarms will drain resources the longer you wait
3. **Resource Spending**: Use consumables freely - better to spend than die with full inventory
4. **Fighting Retreat**: Kill while moving, never stop completely
5. **Time Management**: Taking too long depletes resources needed for extraction scan

## Terminal Commands

- `PING` - Locate extraction zone or other objectives
- `LIST KEYS` - Show all keys in the Complex
- `QUERY KEY_###` - Find specific key location
- `LIST CELL` - Locate power cells for generators
- `LIST RESOURCES` - Find ammo and health stations
- `LIST ZONE_##` - See items and objectives in specific zone

### Resource Depletion Before Extraction

- **Challenge**: Spending too many resources during navigation, leaving none for extraction
- **Solution**: Conserve ammo, use stealth when possible, map resource stations beforehand

### Extraction Scan Overwhelm

- **Challenge**: Error alarm spawns overwhelm team during extraction scan
- **Solution**: Proper sentry placement, C-Foam door reinforcement, focus fire on priorities

### Team Separation

- **Challenge**: Players get separated during navigation or extraction run
- **Solution**: Establish rally points, maintain visual contact, call out positions

### Key/Cell Hunting Delays

- **Challenge**: Wasting time searching for required keys or power cells
- **Solution**: Use terminal commands efficiently (LIST, QUERY, PING), plan retrieval route

### Taking Too Long After Objective

- **Challenge**: Lingering after completing secondary objectives, draining resources
- **Solution**: Move to extraction immediately after objective completion

### Poor Extraction Setup

- **Challenge**: Triggering extraction scan without proper defensive preparation
- **Solution**: Always scout and prepare extraction zone before initiating scan
