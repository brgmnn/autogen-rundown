# HSU Find Sample Objective

## Overview

The **HSU Find Sample** (also known as **Retrieve HSU**) is a mission objective in GTFO that requires players to locate a specific Hydro Stasis Unit, extract a tissue sample from it via bioscan, and return to extraction while surviving continuous enemy waves. This is one of the most common and iconic objective types in the game.

## What is an HSU?

**HSU** stands for **Hydro Stasis Unit** - a containment pod that contains a human specimen preserved in amniotic fluid. The technology uses this fluid to sustain and protect the body while it is kept in an induced comatose state. Players must venture deep into the Complex to retrieve a tissue/DNA sample from one specific HSU among potentially many.

## Objective Flow

### Phase 1: Locating the Target HSU

1. **Check Warden Objective**: The specific HSU unit you must find is displayed in the "Warden Objective" at the top-left of your screen (e.g., `HSU_123`)

2. **Use Terminal Commands**:
   - Locate a terminal in the complex
   - Use the command `QUERY HSU_XXX` (e.g., `QUERY HSU_123`)
   - The terminal will display the zone location (e.g., "HSU_123 is at ZONE 21")
   - Use `PING` command from zone terminals to narrow down the exact area within a zone

3. **Navigate to the HSU**:
   - Keys are commonly required to access certain areas, even ones containing the objective
   - Clear enemies along the path
   - Prepare defenses before interacting with the HSU

### Phase 2: Sample Extraction

1. **Initiate Bioscan**: When you reach the target HSU, hold 'E' to begin extracting the tissue sample
2. **Complete the Bioscan**: Players must remain near the pod to complete the scan
3. **Alarm Triggers**: Upon completing the bioscan, an alarm is triggered spawning enemy waves

### Phase 3: Extraction

1. **Fight Back to Start**: The entire team must fight their way back to the starting point/elevator
2. **Final Scan**: Complete a final bioscan at the extraction point
3. **Continuous Enemy Spawns**: Alarms typically spawn enemies continuously until extraction completes
4. **Victory Condition**: **As long as one player completes the final scan and lives, the team wins**

## Core Mechanics

### Bioscan Process

- **Hold Position**: Players must stand within the bioscan area for the duration
- **Team Requirement**: Often requires multiple team members in the scan zone
- **Interruption**: Moving out of the zone pauses or resets progress
- **Duration**: Varies by mission but typically 15-30 seconds

### Alarm Mechanics

The alarm triggered by the HSU sample extraction varies by expedition:

- **Continuous Spawns**: Common pattern is 3-5 Strikers every 8-50 seconds
- **Error Alarm**: Cannot be deactivated - must survive until extraction
- **Initial Wave**: Some missions spawn a large initial wave followed by continuous spawns
- **Escalation**: Enemy spawns continue and often intensify over time

### Keys and Access

- HSU objectives commonly require keys to access certain areas
- Keys may be found in previous zones or require terminal commands to locate
- Plan your route accounting for locked doors and required keys

## Recommended Strategy

### Before Triggering the HSU

1. **Clear the Path**: Clear all enemies from the HSU location back to extraction
2. **Resource Placement**:
   - Place sentries/turrets at strategic chokepoints along the extraction route
   - Position them BEFORE triggering the HSU bioscan
3. **Resource Management**: Ensure team has sufficient ammo and health
4. **Plan Routes**: Identify the fastest and safest path back to extraction
5. **Communication**: Assign roles (e.g., who carries tools, who provides cover)

### During Extraction

1. **Move Quickly**: Get to the extraction scan ASAP after HSU bioscan completes
2. **Stick Together**: Divided teams are more vulnerable to getting overwhelmed
3. **Use C-Foam**: Reinforce doors along the extraction route to slow enemies
4. **Sentry Coverage**: Position players to cover the bioscan area during final extraction
5. **Accept Losses**: Remember that only ONE player needs to complete the final scan and survive

### Terminal Commands

- `QUERY HSU_XXX` - Locate the target HSU zone
- `PING` - Find specific area within a zone when at zone terminal
- `LIST KEYS` - Locate required keys for locked doors
- `LIST RESOURCES` - Find ammo, health, and tool refill stations

## Comparison to Retrieve Big Items

| Aspect               | HSU Find Sample                      | Retrieve Big Items                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Item Type**        | Tissue sample (invisible/automatic)  | Physical large item (carried)      |
| **Interaction**      | Bioscan at HSU location              | Pick up and transport              |
| **Alarm Timing**     | Triggered at HSU location            | Often triggered at extraction      |
| **Movement**         | Full speed throughout                | Slowed when carrying item          |
| **Team Requirement** | Bioscan may require multiple players | One carrier, team provides support |
| **Extraction**       | Final bioscan at extraction point    | Deliver item to specific location  |

## Common Challenges

### Path Preparation

- **Challenge**: Failing to clear enemies before triggering HSU leads to fighting on two fronts
- **Solution**: Methodically clear and secure the entire extraction route first

### Resource Depletion

- **Challenge**: Running out of ammo during the continuous alarm spawns
- **Solution**: Locate and memorize resource boxes along the route; conserve ammo before HSU trigger

### Team Separation

- **Challenge**: Team gets split during extraction, leading to isolated players being overwhelmed
- **Solution**: Establish rally points and maintain visual contact

### Final Scan Wipe

- **Challenge**: Entire team dies during final extraction scan
- **Solution**: Stagger player positions - not everyone needs to be in scan zone simultaneously

## Tips

- **Scout First**: Locate the HSU and plan your route before committing to the extraction
- **Don't Rush**: Taking an extra 5 minutes to prepare properly can save a failed mission
- **Turret Placement**: Face turrets toward the direction enemies will approach from
- **One Survivor Wins**: If things go badly, prioritize getting ONE player through the final scan
- **Clear Sleeping Enemies**: Don't leave sleepers on the extraction path - they'll wake during the chaos
- **Memorize Terminal Locations**: You may need to return for pings or additional queries
- **Save Mines**: Save mines and C-Foam for the extraction phase when you need them most
