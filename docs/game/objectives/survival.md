# Survival Objective

## Overview

**Survival** (also known as **Survive Warden Protocol**) is a time-based defense objective in GTFO that requires players to survive for a specified duration while defending against waves of enemy spawns. Players are given a short preparation period before the protocol activates, after which enemies spawn at set intervals until the countdown completes. This objective demands strong defensive setup, resource management, and sustained combat capability.

## What is Survive Warden Protocol?

Survive Warden Protocol is a timed survival challenge where the Warden AI initiates a test protocol that spawns waves of enemies at predetermined intervals. Prisoners must hold their position and survive until the protocol timer reaches zero, at which point they can proceed to extraction. The environment may change dynamically during the protocol, with security doors opening, lights toggling, and fog levels rising or lowering.

## Objective Flow

### Phase 1: Protocol Initiation

1. **Check Warden Objective**: Confirm survival duration and requirements
2. **Trigger Protocol**: Specific action initiates survival countdown (terminal command, reaching zone, etc.)
3. **Preparation Timer**: Short countdown before enemies begin spawning
4. **Timer Display**: Both preparation and survival countdowns displayed at top of screen

### Phase 2: Preparation Period

1. **Position Selection**: Choose defensible position for survival sequence
2. **Resource Gathering**: Collect ammunition and consumables in area
3. **Sentry Placement**: Position automated sentries at chokepoints
4. **C-Foam Application**: Reinforce doors and create defensive barriers
5. **Mine Deployment**: Lock down chokepoints with mines
6. **Team Formation**: Establish defensive positions and assign roles
7. **Countdown Awareness**: Monitor preparation timer

### Phase 3: Survival Protocol Active

1. **Enemy Waves Begin**: Enemies spawn at set intervals throughout countdown
2. **Wave Composition**: Enemy types and quantities vary by wave
3. **Environmental Changes**:
   - Security doors may open or close
   - Lights may turn on or off
   - Fog may rise or lower
   - New zones may become accessible
4. **Defend Position**: Hold defensive area against continuous waves
5. **Resource Management**: Conserve ammunition and consumables
6. **Survival Timer**: Monitor countdown to protocol completion

### Phase 4: Protocol Completion and Extraction

1. **Timer Reaches Zero**: Survival protocol completes successfully
2. **Enemy Spawns End**: Wave spawning stops (usually)
3. **Proceed to Extraction**: Navigate to extraction point
4. **Final Extraction**: Complete final extraction scan

## Core Mechanics

### Survival Timer

**Preparation Phase:**
- Brief countdown before protocol activates (typically 10-30 seconds)
- Use this time to establish defenses
- Displayed at top of screen

**Survival Phase:**
- Main countdown showing remaining survival time (typically 30 seconds to several minutes)
- Must survive until timer reaches zero
- Displayed prominently on HUD

### Wave Spawning

**Set Intervals:**
- Enemies spawn at predetermined times
- Wave composition varies (Strikers, Shooters, Giants, Chargers, etc.)
- Intensity typically escalates over time
- Spawn locations may vary

**Special Enemy Types:**
- Some protocols spawn special enemies (Flyers, Shadows, Tanks)
- Example: ALT://R6B1 spawns waves of Flyers for ~35 seconds
- Enemy variety increases survival difficulty

### Environmental Changes

**Dynamic Environment:**
- Security doors may open, revealing new threats or paths
- Lights may toggle, affecting visibility
- Fog may rise or lower, changing infection risk
- Environmental hazards may activate

**Adaptation Required:**
- Team must adapt to changing conditions
- New doors may require repositioning
- Lighting changes affect combat tactics
- Fog requires infection management

### Position Defense

**King of the Hill Mechanics:**
- Some survival objectives require defending specific position
- May involve bioscan circles that must be occupied
- Team must maintain presence in designated area
- Similar to alarm door defense mechanics

## Recommended Strategy

### Preparation Phase

1. **Choose Defensible Position**:
   - Find area with limited approach angles
   - Prefer rooms with few entry points
   - Consider sightlines and cover
   - Near resource boxes if possible
2. **Resource Collection**: Gather all nearby ammo and health
3. **Sentry Placement**:
   - Position 2-4 sentries covering chokepoints
   - Face sentries toward expected spawn directions
   - Angle for overlapping fields of fire
4. **C-Foam Strategy**:
   - Reinforce doors to create choke points
   - Create floor traps to slow enemies
   - Focus on main approach routes
5. **Mine Deployment**:
   - Place mines at entry points
   - Create mine fields in chokepoints
   - Save some mines for later waves

### During Survival Protocol

1. **Hold Position**: Maintain defensive position throughout protocol
2. **Target Priority**:
   - Giants (high health, dangerous)
   - Big Chargers (fast, aggressive)
   - Shooters (ranged threat)
   - Strikers (low priority unless overwhelming)
3. **Resource Conservation**:
   - Use appropriate weapons for each threat
   - Melee small enemies when safe
   - Save heavy ammo for Giants and Chargers
4. **Sentry Maintenance**: Protect sentries from being destroyed
5. **Bio Tracker**: Constantly tag moving enemies for sentry targeting
6. **Communication**: Call out high-priority threats and positions
7. **Rotation**: Players rotate to collect ammo or health if needed
8. **Adapt to Environment**: Respond to door openings, light changes, fog

### Wave Management

1. **Wave Recognition**: Identify enemy composition quickly
2. **Focus Fire**: Coordinate target priority
3. **Choke Control**: Funnel enemies through C-Foam'd areas
4. **Position Maintenance**: Don't abandon defensive setup
5. **Revive Timing**: Revive downed teammates during wave lulls
6. **Ammo Management**: Share ammo packs among team
7. **Timer Awareness**: Track remaining survival time

### Environmental Adaptation

**Door Openings:**
- Quickly assess new threats from opened doors
- Reposition if new approach angle compromises defense
- Have one player watch new entry points

**Lighting Changes:**
- Switch to flashlights if lights go out
- Adjust to darkness or brightness
- Use Bio Tracker more heavily in darkness

**Fog Changes:**
- Monitor infection levels if fog rises
- Use Fog Repellers if available
- Navigate carefully through fog areas

## Terminal Commands

Survival objectives typically don't require extensive terminal usage during the protocol, but beforehand:

- `PING` - Locate objectives or resources
- `LIST RESOURCES` - Find ammo and health stations near survival area
- Special commands may trigger survival protocol (varies by expedition)
