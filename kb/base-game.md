# GTFO

GTFO is a 4-player hardcore co-op action horror FPS. You and your friends will explore hostile and terrifying environments where, in an instant, you are thrown from edge-of-your-seat suspense to frantic action. It's a large-scale experience, testing players in their ability to gear up and adapt to an endless string of unknown and ever-changing challenges.

Every expedition in GTFO is unique and the game lets you make informed decisions on what equipment and weapons to bring - but even then survival is not guaranteed.

GTFO throws so many curveballs and unknown factors at you that you and your team always have to stay on your toes - and the atmosphere is suffocatingly tense. It's nerve wracking to play even for us developers! If you're easily scared, wear your brown pants.

GTFO was released for early access on December 9, 2019, before being officially released exactly two years later, on December 9, 2021. 

## Story

GTFO is about a team of four people trapped in an underground Complex, kept there against their will, forced down into the depths to carry out different objectives for an unknown entity called the Warden. The underground Complex has been abandoned for many years and it's been overrun by flesh-eating, grotesque monsters, and you want to get out of there.

As you progress deeper into the Complex, the story will be told not only by the characters themselves, but by clues and hints found in the environment.

## Characters

There are 4 playable characters in GTFO:

    Hackett: An Irish native described as cynical and comical but reliable.
    Bishop: A distrustful and pragmatic Englishman who is interested in getting the job done.
    Woods: A thoughtful American who believes in deeper meaning.
    Dauda: A determined and cunning but secretive Nigerian.

The dialogue system in GTFO is fluid and dynamic. Depending on what type of action and atmosphere players are experiencing, the banter between the characters will change reflexively.

## Gameplay

GTFO players form a team of four prisoners who are forced to explore the vast underground complex while completing The Warden's work orders. Complicating the process is the presence of hideous monsters, who have overrun the whole area. The players must gather resources to survive, and work to unearth the answers about the past and how to escape.

GTFO requires teamwork to solve puzzles, and for finding items.

* Hacking: Some lockers and doors can be hacked opened/to retrieve whatever is inside, like keycards, ammo packs, medpacks, etc.
* Bioscan: Some doors require a bioscan for entry. All players present in the current play session must stand in the highlighted area.
* Stealth: Although some of us might prefer to just barge in and slay the horrors rambo-style, it can be a tremendous waste of resources and there is no reward for this approach. If we assume ammo and health are limited, then triggering too many hordes will result in running dry and leaving us with only melee and low health. Therefore, quiet creeping might be the preferred method of moving through the Complex.
* Engaging combat: Monsters will impede player progress to the next objective, but players should only engage them because they stand in the way or pose a threat to your ability to scavenge or complete the objective, not because the act of killing them in itself is rewarding in any way. Therefore, players should kill enemies in the most controlled way you can, such as a crouched approach with sledgehammer.
* Progression: GTFO has no leveling system.

## Features

* 4 player co-op: Invite friends or join a random group to face the nightmare plunge into the unknown depths of the Complex together.
* Terrifying monsters: From split-faced mutant minions that eject tentacles to giants mutants, you won't be able to relax until it's all over.
* Visceral gore: Popping heads of monsters with well-aimed shots can be bloody, but so is smashing mutant skulls with a sledgehammer.
* Unique weapons and tools: A fast-firing smg with a large magazine is good for laying waste to the lesser minions, and for tougher, special monsters you can use the high-powered machine-gun. For the real fireworks though, set up a sentry gun or even trip mines to do the job for you.
* Evolving storyline: Instead of a campaign mode to tell the story of the Complex and the Warden, the truth is revealed through a series of free post-release updates.
* Teamwork and puzzles: More than focusing fire to slay the Horde, GTFO requires teamwork to progress through the Complex. Locked gates need keys or passcodes that can be acquired through coordination among the players to find and use.
* Challenging encounters: The developers are focused on putting a lot of layered challenges in GTFO, and by mixing and matching these challenges (different enemies combined with different environmental hazards combined with different expedition objectives) they create interesting but difficult gameplay experiences.
* Absolutely no P2W (pay-to-win) or loot boxes: Skill and teammates are all that is needed in GTFO, and there will never be pay-to-win microtransactions or overpowered weapons to buy.

## Environments

The gameplay of GTFO takes part in a variety of different locations within The Complex. Some levels take part in dark tunnels created by mining equipment, while others take place in abandoned laboratory sectors, sewage waterways, and lush garden environments. Often there is a significant amount of darkness and fog, hiding hazards to the players. Sometimes players are thrust into wide open rooms, while other times they must traverse tight, miserable corridors.

* Ladders are easily climbable. Simply walk into it (or away from it) and the animation begins (or ends).
* Enemies can breach doors with force.
* Resource boxes contain ammopacks, medpacks, and tool refill kits. Ammo packs replenish ammo for both primary and secondary weapons. Medpacks replenish player health. Tool refill kits replenish the ammunition for tools like the C-Foam Launcher, Sentries, and Mine Deployer.
* Maps: The developers have created tools in order to create levels more effectively, which then they personally touch up to make sure it's perfect for what they have had in mind.

## Audio

* Music Cues: Dynamic system that reflects what is currently happening. In stealth, the music is eerie and somber, but for a Horde onslaught, the music escalates to hectic and intense.
* Enemy Cues: Atmospheric sound in games not only provide ambience in the environment for immersion, but offer clues as to what is happening and about to happen. The Horde rallying cry is well known, the Shadow scream is unmistakable, the squishy sound is a Scout's floating feelers, and the slithering crawler will hiss at your feet.

## Replayability

* The replayability of the missions will be high, as enemy and resource spawns are randomized.


# Lore

## Background & Narrative

The events of GTFO are viewed through the experiences of Prisoners; a group of four prisoners (a quad) who undertake a series of expeditions throughout The Complex infested by strange lifeforms referred to as Sleepers. Before and between expeditions, prisoners are suspended in Hydro-Stasis Units (HSUs), devices that can keep a human being in a comatose, death-like, state for a prolonged time. They receive cryptic orders from the Warden, the team's unseen handler, through Cortex Neural Interface grafted into their brains. The four playable Prisoners are Woods, Dauda, Hackett and Bishop. The four characters are the same throughout all Rundowns. The game is set around the year 2063, about a decade after the Complex was abandoned and overrun by Sleepers.

In the early missions, the prisoners work to restore the Warden's control over the facility and beyond it. The Complex is revealed to contain alien technology and equipment making it possible to travel to other dimensions, which are turned to be also infested by Sleepers. Later, the Prisoners are contacted by John Schaeffer, a lone survivor who is antagonistic towards the Warden and seeks to bring the Prisoners to his side and to destroy the Warden and the entire Complex.

According to the Dual Reality Theory, there are two different worldlines or variants of the story set in parallel universes. The original worldline represents the game's early access' Rundowns and the alternate worldline corresponds to the "replacement" Rundowns (ALT://) from the game's final version. The original worldline's prisoners and Schaeffer succeed to rebel against the Warden and defeat him. Their alternate worldline's equivalents learn about the Collectors and seek to escape to a safe dimension ("clean membrane"), untouched by Sleeper infestation. In Rundown 8.0, the alternate group of Prisoners and alternate Schaeffer travel to the original worldline, where the Warden was destroyed but their doubles still present. To escape, the two teams of characters have to interact with each other. 

## The Complex and the Inner

The Complex is owned by a corporation called Santonian Industries, also referred as Santonian Mining Company (SMC). The facility is located in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, in the asteroid impact crater Chicxulub. The crater was left by an ancient asteroid that hit Earth 66 million years ago, causing an extinction level event that killed the dinosaurs.

Santonian Industries initially started building the Complex in 2049 as a mining enterprise. They sought to extract the rare element iridium, supposedly brought to Earth by the asteroid. Their surveys revealed a massive underground iridium-containing object, thought at the time to be a massive iridium ore vein, 1.5 to 2 kilometers wide and at least 4 kilometers deep.[1] The mining was plagued with strange happenings, miners becoming sick, disappearing or inexplicably killing themselves.[2].

The underground object, latter dubbed "the Inner"[3] or "the fossil"[4], turned out to be not a mass of iridium ore but an artificial structure of extraterrestrial origin, built from an alloy the researches called Cretasium 77a. It was an ancient spacecraft equipment, apparently belonging to an alien race dubbed the Collectors.[5] Humans also contacted living creatures (Sleepers) somehow surviving inside the Inner for millions of years.[6] With heightened security and growing presence of Sleepers, the company shifted its interests to researching the Inner and the Collectors' legacy. This research was handled by another subsidiary of Dreyfus corporation, Project Insight.

Between 2053 and 2056, the Complex and the outer world experienced a series of apocalyptic events linked to the Inner. The virus NAM-V escaped from the Complex in 2052 and ravaged the planet in a global pandemic,[7] killing most or all of the world's population over several years. In November 2053, a massive power surge coming from in the Inner, supposedly caused by drilling operations breaking into sensitive power systems of the alien spacecraft, devastated parts of the Complex and created multiple blast tunnels to the surface, the same the Warden uses in game to deliver the Prisoners to the lower levels. As Santonian's management was killed in the explosion, the Project Insight's scientists seized power.[8] Project Insight built the Matter Wave Projector as means to travel to other dimensions, particularly the Destination. They were also continuing the Rise Project, a KDS human cloning program initially seeking to replace prisoner recruits with even more disposable clones.[9] Two years later, in November 2055, Biocom stopped answering to human commands, resulting in complete loss of control.[10] The Complex was abandoned and overrun by Sleepers, albeit with thousands of humans still cold-stored in HSUs. 

## KSOs, HSU, Schaeffer and the Warden

Security services at the Complex were provided by Kovac Defense Services (KDS), a private military contractor with an army of Kovac Security Operators, stored in HSUs and supervised by an artificial intelligence Biocom. HSU, or Hydrostasis Storage Unit, was a technology initially developed by Kovac Research for space exploration as anabiosis chambers that would store lifeless human bodies without the need of food, water or oxygen and safely resuscitate the stored person on arrival. The technology was turned out to affect human brain, leaving the resuscitated person without memory, confused about his or her own identity and increasingly aggressive. This resulted in a catastrophic failure of the Red Alpha mission to Mars. As part of Project Legion, Kovac repurposed the technology to military application and improved it by fitting prisoner or volunteer subjects with neural implants telling them what to do. Over time, Santonian also made recourse to using the HSU and implant technology to control their civilian workers, effectively turning everyone in the Complex into obedient KSO equivalents.[11] The four game characters are KSOs, though only Woods and Bishop were actual prisoners that were sent to the procedure by force. Hackett joined the program voluntarily.

The Warden, or WRDN, is the entity that gives the Prisoners their orders over their implants and sends them on expeditions. Initially, the computer Biocom was built by Kovac Defense Services to supervise and direct their KSO forces. Santonium and later the Project Insight had relied on Biocom and KSOs as their life-critical security force, but, as the Warden wrested control over the system in 2055, the Complex was left defenseless and ultimately fall to Sleepers. The scientist Dauda, middle-rank manager Schaeffer and engineer Henrikkson were all civilian specialists who survived the fall by entering HSUs. As everyone in the Complex were fitted with implants, the Warden treats every living human, including Dauda and Schaeffer, as a KSO who can be awoken from a HSU and put to tasks according to the Warden's goals.

By the time of ALT://Rundown 4.0, John Schaeffer came to think about the Warden as a "program", a rogue AI that somehow hijacked the system.[12] In the original worldline, Schaeffer and his allies were successful in introducing a trojan into the mainframe computer, thus defeating the Warden once for all and returning the control into the hands of humans. In the alternate worldline, in ALT://Rundown 6.0, Schaeffer get into contact with the Collectors' conscience through the Conduit. The aliens revealed themselves as the force behind the Warden ("The Warden is of us") and informed Schaeffer of their benevolent goals. As this world and all other world previously visited by the Collectors were infected by the virus and Earth is apparently lost as well, the Collectors intended for the surviving humans to escape to a "clean membrane", a safe world unaffected by the virus.[13] 

## NAM-V, Parasites and Sleepers

NAM-V is a virus that had been lying dormant in the Inner for millions of years. Together with the parasites is responsible for the birth of Sleepers and other environmental hazards within the Complex. It is also found in the Destination, and, according to the Conduit, in all membranes previously visited by the Collectors. The Collectors themselves were troubled by apparent omnipresence of the virus across multiple worlds. It became "the primary life force" of every membrane it infected.[13] In 2050s, the virus escaped Garganta and spread across the planet. It is extremely infectious and lethal, with multiple ways of being transmitted and infecting other lifeforms.[14] While there is no vaccine or cure outside the Complex, HSU works as a form of treatment, effectively killing both the human and the virus in their body and bringing the human back to life.[15]

The parasites are a species from the Collection, the number of lifeforms from various worlds gathered by the Collectors as part of their journey across the multiverse.[6] Unlike humans or other alien species, the parasites are not killed by NAM-V but form a symbiotic union beneficial for both organisms: the virus keeps the parasite alive for an indefinite period of time, and the parasite ensures the virus' survival and propagation.[13] They both seek to infect any other lifeforms.[15]

Sleepers are a product of this symbiotic relationship. Their bodies are made of parasites infected with the virus and typically quickly decay and disappear if killed. Nonetheless, research teams found some Sleepers that do not dematerialize after death. Analysis of those bodies show traces of human DNA, with speculations that these abnormal Sleepers might have once been Garganta staff.[16] Sleepers form simple hive-like communities that can stay dormant for millions of years without the need for food, with highly specialized forms of Sleepers like the Scout taking various roles in the survival and defense of the species. While Sleepers found in the Complex are curiously human-like, their kin on the Destination like Flyers or the Kraken look completely alien, apparently based on local extinct lifeforms. 

## Sub-plots

There are a number of sub-plots throughout GTFO which either expand on the main story or offer insight into the state of the world before and after the NAM-V pandemic. They are told in a series of text and audio recordings found on various terminals across the game. 

* Daylight Mission, an expedition by the World Health Organization (WHO) to uncover the origin of NAM-V virus that doomed the world. In 2057, at the peak of the pandemic, the Daylight Mission identified "patient zero" and traced him back to the Complex. The team descended to the facility and tried to download medical records but was destroyed by the Warden.
* EF01, an attempt of the Project Insight's scientists and KSOs, including Dr. Durant and Bishop, explore other worlds using the Matter Wave Projector. In the original worldline, the team arrived to the Destination, a barren planet infested by Sleepers. In the alternate worldline, the team arrived to a vibrant jungle world apparently devoid of any Sleeper threat.
* Mambo Media Services, a news group serving as a source of information on the outside world, from the Red Alpha and the increase of iridium prices to the apocalypse caused by the NAM-V pandemic.
* State of Truth, a radio show hosted by Mr. Truth, a fringe conspiracy theorist from a town of Pahrump, Nevada. Mr. Truth received information about the Chicxulub Complex, Santonian and NAM-V and attempted to raise awareness about various secret operations and cover-ups.

The lore of GTFO includes many inter-twined narratives and stories. These are documented on the Frequently asked questions article.


# How to play

GTFO is a 4-player cooperative first-person shooter, with elements of stealth, resource management and position defence. This guide will act as a very basic introduction to the game and its mechanics. If you would like more information to look at the individual pages or learn for yourself in-game.

## Complete Training

The first thing you should do when launching GTFO for the first time is to complete the Training expedition. This will cover the basics of how to play in a controlled environment. 

## Before you play

### How to find a group to play with

The first option is to play with friends who already have the game, either by using the Lobby Id system or by joining through Steam.

If you do not have friends who already have the game, the in-game matchmaking system is also an option. The matchmaking has a few options, such as Primary language, secondary language and a mic option, which lets you decide if you want to have people using the in-game voice chat or not. The matchmaking however has a few drawbacks, with it choosing between a pool of levels instead of a specific one and possibly encountering cheaters, which is why many people use the third option:

The official GTFO Discord contains several channels dedicated to players looking for groups to play with. There is more information on the Discord server itself. Once you have enough people ready to play you can use the lobby ID system: the host is able to copy a lobby ID to their clipboard, which can then be shared with the other people playing, they copy it to their clipboard, and when in-game you will have an option on the Rundown screen to join the lobby.

Finally, if you don't want to add other players, you can fill your lobby slots with bots.

While the game can be played with less than 4 players/bots, it is an unwise choice as there is no difficulty scaling, meaning you will face the same number of enemies with a lower amount of firepower. This does make for a good challenge if you find yourself bored with the current rundown. Playing solo will prove to be extremely difficult, much of the time even impossible depending on the mission. However, it can make for extremely good practice with certain skills necessary to play the game well, i.e room clearing. 

### Selecting your load-out

When in the lobby within GTFO you will be able to select a primary weapon, special weapon, tool and melee weapon.

Primary weapons are generalized weapons which are meant to be usable in most situations, they have larger ammo reserves and are effective against most enemy types.

Special weapons are meant for more specific situations, they have lower ammo reserves but excel in their own ways.

Tools are used to give tactical advantages, for both inside and outside of combat, they are meant to make situations more manageable, but can have limited ammo like weapons.

Melee weapons are your choice to conserve ammo. They inflict different amounts of damage, effective range, stagger and other stats.

### Prisoners

Prisoners are the player characters within GTFO, there are four different prisoners to play as, determined by your position in the lobby. You can change the apparel of your character (Helmet/Torso/Legs/Backpack/Palette). 

## Basic mechanics

The flashlight can be turned on and off (F by default), the flashlight will change depending on which weapon you are using, flashlights will make enemies stir and alert if they are shined onto them for too long, so be careful with it.

Pinging (Middle Mouse by default) can be used on item boxes, items in boxes and doors, these pings will appear to all players and be visible from anywhere, they also are shown in the color of your name in-game.

There is also a map accessible (TAB by default), which can be used to navigate the expeditions and to temporarily draw on.

Prisoners can also crouch, which will reduce speed but make less sound allowing you to get closer to enemies within stealth; sprint, which is faster but much louder; and jump, which can be used to get to vantage points, though fall damage is very punishing so care should be taken when around heights.

Friendly fire is always on in GTFO, the only weapons which do not have friendly fire are melee weapons. Turrets and mines will not target players, however, they can still damage a player if they hit one.

Prisoners can be afflicted with infection while in the complex, the infection will cause your max health to be limited and slowly drain when above the limit. Infection can be gained from multiple sources and can be removed by multiple means. It is represented by a green bar above your health that only appears after a certain infection level. 

## Expeditions

Levels in GTFO (or expeditions) are grouped into Rundowns. Each Rundown contains a group of levels that range in difficulty, with the tier of the level acting as an indication of how hard it is. The easiest expeditions are in tier A, while the hardest are in Tier E. In the past, when a new Rundown was released the previous Rundown became inaccessible, though that is no longer the case and from now on all released Rundowns will be permanently accessible.

Expeditions are the levels within GTFO, taking place within the complex, an underground facility. The objective of an expedition is a task given by the warden, visible in the top left of the screen for most of the level. Unless otherwise specified, there is no time limit for any of these objectives or expeditions, so, in general, take your time. 

### Warden objectives

The objectives within GTFO are the only thing you should care about. If something isn't going to help you achieve your objective, don't do it, and once you've completed your objective, don't stick around, just GTFO. The objective for an expedition will never change, however, some parts of it may change, such as the locations of items you are collecting. The number of items you must collect in the level will always be the same. 

### Lockers and boxes

Within expeditions there are items the players can find which can be helpful or necessary for the completion of a level, they are found within lockers and boxes (distinct orange colour). There are 3 types of items which can be found within containers: Items (divided into Resource packs and Consumables), Keys and Objective items.

All these items- ergo their containers- can be randomly placed with each playthrough, however, their amounts are consistent, excepting consumables which can vary in number. 

### Doors

Doors within an expedition will always be the same. They are useful tools if utilised correctly, but can be dangerous if alarmed. There are two types of doors: 

* Normal doors which can be opened and closed at will. They can also be reinforced with C-Foam to withstand more punishment. If closed, enemies will destroy them if they are in the direct path towards the player. 
* Security doors which can be opened, but cannot be closed. To open a security door you will often have to complete a bioscan, which requires players to stand in a designated area for a short time. Some security doors will be protected with an alarm. Alarms will cause waves of enemies to spawn until deactivated by additional scans. The number and type of extra scans can vary, but is generally indicated by the alarm's class. 

### Locks

Locks are obstacles which will block a player from being able to open a door or resource locker/box. There are two types, physical and electrical. Physical locks can be removed by melee or bullets and makes a noise in a small range around it when broken alerting sleepers. Electrical locks require a hacking minigame, which when failed will make a noise in a small range, alerting sleepers. 

### Zones and areas

Within expeditions, there are parts of the level which are categorized into different zones and areas. These are shown with both numbers and letters. Zones are separated with security doors, areas are separated by normal doors. There are exceptions to this rule in the form of holes within walls you can enter. 

### Terminals

Terminals within GTFO are the main source of information within each expedition, they can be used to see which items are in which rooms, find specific items and at some objective specific points do special commands.

On a terminal typing "help" and "commands" will be helpful to learn how to use them to their full potential. 

### Bulkheads

Bulkheads, more specifically Bulkhead Doors and Bulkhead Door Controllers, are a mechanic related to Sectors, the bulkhead doors act as a way to enter the areas of the map which feature the layered difficulty, or as a way of preventing players from completing some parts of an expedition before a certain sector. 

## Enemies

Sleepers are the main enemy within GTFO, and as their name suggests you will find most of them within a dormant state, though there are some which prefer to stay awake. 

### Stealth

To succeed within GTFO a large part is being able to keep within stealth, this is not mandatory, but it saves ammo and health. Sleepers can be killed stealthily with the melee weapon if killed in one hit, if you do not kill them with the first hit, they wake up, and if not killed quickly, they alert the rest of the dormant enemies close to it with a scream. If you make too much noise and do not pay attention to the warnings of lighting up and they begin to thrash around or continue to shine a light on them when the same warning signs happen. Killing a sleeper too close to another sleeper will cause that sleeper to wake up (~5 meters). Sleepers glowing are more vigilant and will detect a sleeper being killed from longer distances. Sleepers are affected by line of sight, killing a sleeper in an area where other sleepers would not be able to see it will not alert them even if they are glowing. 

### Biology

Sleepers are resilient, being able to live without their heads and all their top halves in some special cases, however, they do have weak points which can be exploited to reliably kill them quickly and instantly in some cases. The different variations of enemies have different health, damage, movement speed and weak-points. 

### Tips

* Aim for the weak spots.
* Don’t waste ammo when not needed.
* Running away is not always bad, but be careful with your stamina.
* Utilize your environment.
* Communicate.

# Mission Objectives

## HSU Find Sample

Retrieving an "HSU" or Hydro Stasis Unit, a containment pod that contains a human specimen, that the players must venture into the Complex to retrieve a tissue sample off one specific unit. 

The goal of an HSU mission is to explore the level and navigate through the numerous zones dotted around the map and obtain clues on where the pod is located. It can't just be any Hydro Stasis Unit, you will be informed of what specific unit you must look for in the "Warden Objective" located at the top-left of your screen, the objective will look something like HSU_123.

A terminal must be located for you to pinpoint where the general area the HSU is located, when found the following command QUERY HSU_NUMBERS (ex: QUERY HSU_123) will compile a search for the objective, and when done successfully the specific zone will be displayed on where the HSU is stored at (ex: HSU_123 is at ZONE 21).

A mandatory second objective common in HSU missions are keys that are required to access certain areas, even ones that contain the objective, these must be sought in order for you to complete the mission.

When the player reaches their objective, they must hold 'E' to obtain a tissue sample by standing near the pod, complete a scan which will trigger an alarm, and the whole team must fight their way back to the starting point of the mission and complete a final scan for extraction. As long as one player completes the final scan and lives the team wins. 

## Special Terminal Command

The Terminal Command objective, also known as Input Command, is an objective that requires players to input a specific command into one or more terminals, and occasionally, complete a bioscan. Completing executing the commands (and completing the scan where necessary) can have a variety of effects depending on the expedition — such as cutting power to the lights, filling the area with infectious fog, opening security doors, and spawning enemy waves.

Players can use the auto-complete function of terminals (TAB key by default) to quickly input commands. 

## Power Cell Distribution

A mission with the goal of bringing Power Cells to multiple Generators around the map. 

The goal of this mission is to bring power cells, which are given to you at the start of the mission in a cargo container, to different generators around the map. These generators will be spread out across multiple zones, making terminals very helpful in locating them. The cells must be carried to the generators, which will reduce your movement speed greatly. Due to this, it is a good idea to bring them along with you throughout the mission as you clear zones, keeping in mind where you ultimately need to bring them, instead of going back to the beginning every time you need to place a cell into a generator. Placing the cells into the generators does not typically cause any alarms or mission complications on its own. 

## Clear Path

Clear a Path is the simplest objective in GTFO, and requires the prisoners to reach an extraction point. Often, prisoners will encounter complications, such as alarms, restoring power to generators, and finding keys, which all combine to make this seemingly simple task more challenging. 

### Background

Within the lore, the purpose of the objective can be a number of things, such as to distract a troublesome biomass from interfering in another expedition, or to open the zone for some unknown future purpose. 

## Survival

The Survive Warden Protocol objective is one of the most varied challenges in GTFO and first appeared in Rundown 005. To complete this objective, prisoners must survive for the duration of the "Warden Protocol" before they are able to extract.

Prisoners are given a short preparation time before the protocol activates. Afterwhich, waves of enemies will spawn at set intervals throughout the countdown. In addition, the environment may also change: security doors may open, lights may turn on or off, and fog may rise or lower. These changes occur with specific phases of the protocol (e.g. after ten minutes in ALT://R5B4.)

Both the preparation time and the actual countdown are displayed for all players at the top of the screen. 

## Timed Terminal Sequence

The Timed Sequence objective is an objective that requires players to input specific commands into two terminals in quick succession. This objective was introduced in R7D1.
TimedSequence

HUD displaying the second terminal ID and countdown

The sequence order is as follows:

* To start the timed sequence, players need to find the correct terminal and enter the command INIT_TIMED_CONNECTION. Entering this command will keep spawning in various enemies until the sequence is completed. This will also display the ID of another terminal on both the initial terminal as well as each players HUD and will start a countdown.
* Players will have to locate this second terminal and enter the command VERIFY_TIMED_CONNECTION. This will start a second, shorter countdown.
* Players then have to enter the command CONFIRM_TIMED_CONNECTION into the initial terminal to complete the sequence.

Should the players fail to input the commands within the time limit, enemies will be spawned in and the sequence will restart. It is helpful to take note of nearby terminal IDs and their location to quickly navigate to them once the sequence is initiated.

Players can use the auto-complete function of terminals (TAB key by default) to quickly input commands.

Because of the short time frame between the second and third command input, this objective can be impossible to complete when playing alone or with only bots depending on the distance between the objective terminals.
